---++ Overview

This is a runtime engine component from [[Foswiki:Development.FoswikiStandAlone][Foswiki Standalone]] architecture.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_perl][mod_perl]] is the
[[http://perl.apache.org/][Perl API]] to the
[[http://httpd.apache.org/][Apache]] web server. It permits to hook applications
into Apache, providing good performance and great flexibility.

It has better performance than
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface][CGI]] because it loads
and compile apps at apache initialization and apps are kept in memory as long
as apache itself, so there is no need to fork+load+compile all the code for
each request.

---++ Installation Instructions

Install [[Foswiki:Extensions/ModPerlEngineContrib][ModPerlEngineContrib]]
either manually (download the package and extract its contents over your
foswiki directory) or using [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]] script
(under =Extensions= section, push the =Find More Extensions= button).

Visit the [[Foswiki:Support/ApacheConfigGenerator][apache config generator]]
and fill the fields according to your environment. Select __mod_perl__ as your
__Runtime Engine__ and choose your apache version. Push the ==Update config file== 
button and you'll get your config file.

%X% %RED% When installed for the first time, foswiki *must* be configured. Run
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]] script *before* enabling this contrib
or else Apache will not start, reporting an error about missing
lib/LocalSite.cfg %ENDCOLOR%

In the web server configuraiton you will need to load mod_perl but also make sure to load the
[[http://httpd.apache.org/apreq/][Apache HTTP Request Library]] (module apreq).
If apreq is not loaded the following error may be encountered in certain situations e.g. during login:
<verbatim>
apache2: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/perl5/auto/APR/Request/Apache2/Apache2.so: undefined symbol: apreq_handle_apache2
</verbatim>

---+++ Foswiki configuration tuning

Fork new processes under =mod_perl= can be very slow, so some configuration
changes are recommended.

Access the [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]] script and click the =Yes, I've read all the documentation=
button to show the expert settings.
Go to =Store Settings=:
   * ={StoreImpl}=: adjust to =RcsLite=
   * ={RCS}{SearchAlgorithm}=: use =Foswiki::Store::SearchAlgorithms::PurePerl= or Foswiki:Extensions/NativeSearchContrib

---++ Known Issues

   * Apache must be restarted in order to configuration changes take effect.
   * The =bin/configure= script is an exception and should be run as a plain 
   CGI script. If you are using some extension that adds files to =bin/= 
   directory you should configure them to be run as plain CGI scripts: since 
   they were not designed to be executed under mod_perl you may face problems. 
   You can replace =Files= directive by
   [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#filesmatch][FilesMatch]] 
   and list all the exceptions.
